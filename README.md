Because assignments are sometimes reused, the actual code cannot be posted in this repo, but a description for each homework assignment is below (all code was done in C++): 

HW 1: Implement a memory manager to simulate how memory is handled in a language like C++, where memory allocated to the heap must be manually deallocated.

HW 2: Used recursion and linked lists to create a game of duck-duck-goose

HW 3: Implemented circularly linked lists, stacks, and queues. 

HW 4: Project Part 1 - Built Scrabble game to allow human players to play against each other with all game rules implemented.

HW 5: Implemented a variety of different templated functions and comparators

HW 6: Worked with graph traversal and search algorithms as well as heaps

HW 7: Worked with AVL Trees and BSTs

HW 8: Project Part 2 - Added 2 CPU player strategies (longest-word and highest-scoring) to the Scrabble game, and implemented with tries.
